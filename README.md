# Milestone 3 - 

## About

This is a website is a platfrom for sharing recipes that are healthy and will be ready fast. Real food really fast. Its main purpose is recipe sharing among users. Users can register an account, add recipes and search through existing recipes. Fast Food is an educational project used for the purpose of my Milestone 3/Data Centric Module project for the Code Institute.

A live version of the website can be found .... along with its repository ....

## UX Design 

The aim of FastFood was to create an online cookbook of fast and healthy recipes. User will be able to make real healthy food really fast, recipes should all be 30 minutes or less start to finish! Users will be able to find and share recipes with each other. 

### Business Scope

2. As a returning user I want to;
    * Find the log in to my account area

3. As the owner/adiminitrator I want to;

    * Edit and delete recipes
    * Display results that are visually appealing and user friendly

### Design

Used [Abode Color](https://color.adobe.com/explore) to get an idea of a color scheme for site. Type in 'healthy food' and went with a red/green/orange there. Colors associated with fruits and vegetables.
