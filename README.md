# Milestone 3 - 

## About

This is a website is a platfrom for sharing recipes that are healthy and will be ready fast. Real food really fast. Its main purpose is recipe sharing among users. Users can register an account, add recipes and search through existing recipes. Fast Food is an educational project used for the purpose of my Milestone 3/Data Centric Module project for the Code Institute.
